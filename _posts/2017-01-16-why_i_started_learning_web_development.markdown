**For the Challenge**
One of the main reasons I decided to start learning web development is for the intense challenge. I have always had a strong interest in technology, computers, and problem-solving, ever since I was just a kid. It started when I was about six years old and played my first video game, *Super Mario 64*; I enjoyed the fun challenges throughout each level. Later throughout my education, I engaged in my first Computer Science course in high school. It started with Scratch and Alice programming, then in College while I pursued my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I learned about the Java programming language, among other languages such as C and Visual Basic. Ultimately, my hobbies have centered around learning new challenging ideas.

**For the Fun of it**
I believe that learning new things is inherently fun, especially learning items that are technology focused or based on programming, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Also, since **learning never ends**, especially in the development or technology industry, I will never stop having fun! I find excitement in online learning resources, such as Learn.co, and am definitely enjoying the many activities and challenges.

**For Setting Myself Apart**
Since technology is *advancing so rapidly* and that computer-based technologies are always in dire need for businesses and industries alike, web development is one item that I feel I can grasp with hard work and set myself apart from "the norm" with. Individuals who enjoy learning tough ideas (at first) and who are excited and have a great attitude for learning, are definitely in need.
